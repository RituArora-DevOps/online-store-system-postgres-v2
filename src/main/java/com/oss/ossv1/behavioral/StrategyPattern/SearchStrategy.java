/**
 * Strategy interface to abstract search logic.
 * This design helps in filtering on the client side, using the data already fetched (e.g., from /products) and stored in the ProductRegistry
 *
 * Benefits:
 *  Reduces backend calls
 *  Improves UI responsiveness
 *  Keeps filtering logic extensible via Strategy Pattern
 *
 * SOLID:
 * - SRP: This interface has one reason to change â€” if search behavior abstraction needs change.
 * - OCP: New strategies can be added without modifying this interface.
 * - DIP: High-level ProductController depends on this abstraction.
